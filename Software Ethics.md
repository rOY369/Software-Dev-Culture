# Software Ethics

> As a Computing Professional, I pledge to practice my profession with the highest level of integrity and competence.
> I shall be honest about my limitations, continuously seeking to improve my skills through life-long learning.

 **Basic Profession Standard**
 
 The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly release code that is defective either in behaviour or structure. I will not ship bad code in order to meet a schedule or to yield to pressure. 
 - I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve the code at every opportunity. I will never make the code worse.
 - I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.
 - I will never stop learning and improving my craft.
